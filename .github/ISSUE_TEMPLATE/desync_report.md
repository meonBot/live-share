If you are using VS Code, the following will provide helpful information.

On both the host and the guest:
- Enable the `liveshare.diagnosticMode` setting
- Open the file that's out of sync
- Run the `liveshare.getCoeditingInformation` command (`ctrl+shift+p` to open the command palette, then search for "Get co-editing information") and paste the results below

**Host co-editing information:**

**Guest co-editing information:**
