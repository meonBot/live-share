# üìì Notebooks

Notebooks have become a key part of many developer's and data scientist's workflow. With Visual Studio Code offering a rich, native notebook-editor, we're excited to enable a real-time collaboration experience, that will allow teams and classrooms to use notebooks and Live Share together.

The Live Share notebook experience is currently in preview, and therefore, has some [pre-requisitions](#pre-requisites) and [known issues](#known-issues) to be aware of. We'll be iterating rapidly on this initial preview release, and therefore, please don't hesitate to [send us any questions/feedback](http://github.com/microsoftdocs/live-share)) as you're evaluating it üëç<br />

## Pre-Requisites

Before you can start trying out collaborative notebooks, you need to install the following pre-requisites as part of this preview release:

| Pre-Requisite | Host-Required? | Guest-Required? |
|-|-|-|
| Visual Studio Insiders | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Live Share v1.0.3541+ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| The neccessary notebook extensions (e.g. Jupyter) | ‚úÖ | _N/A_ (Live Share takes care of this!) |

## Getting Started

Once you and your participants have the proper pre-requisites, you can start using Live Share and notebooks using the following steps:

1. Open a notebook within Visual Studio Code
1. Start a Live Share session
1. Once your guests join, you can start co-editing cells and seeing each other's cursors and text highlights
1. Have fun collaborating on notebooks! üéâ 

## Known Issues

The following list represents the set of known issues with the current Live Share notebook experience, along with their respective workarounds: 

| Issue | Workaround | 
|-|-|
| "Follow mode" doesn't track scrolling within a notebook | We're working on proper "follow" support for notebooks, but in the meantime, you'll need to manually scroll to the right notebook cell you want to co-edit with your participants. |
| Adding/deleting/moving cells aren't synchronized amongst participants | Save the notebook document and have everyone re-open it. In the future, we'll fully synchronize notebook-level operations in real-time. |
| Notebook editors don't respect read-only Live Share sessions | While guests are able to edit notebook cells, they won't be able to actually save them to disk, and therefore, your security is retained in a read-only session. |
